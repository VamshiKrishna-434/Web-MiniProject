    <h1 color="white">About this App.</h1>
    <p class="p">
        This app is developed using "Rapid API",a open source weather api.A weather API (Application Programming Interface)is a web-based interface that allows developers to access up-to-date
        weather data for a specific location. Weather APIs typically provide a range of weather-related data such as current
        temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, as well as forecast information for future days.
        
        Using a weather API, developers can build weather-related applications, such as weather apps, travel apps, and
        agriculture apps, among others. Weather data can be used to provide personalized recommendations, to optimize business
        operations, or to improve public safety.
        
        Weather APIs typically use data from weather stations, weather radars, satellites, and other sources to provide accurate
        and reliable weather information. They often require a developer to register for an API key to gain access to the data,
        and may charge fees based on the volume of requests or the specific features used. Overall, weather APIs provide a
        valuable resource for developers looking to incorporate real-time weather data into their applications.

    <p class="p">
        The fetch() function is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to make network requests to fetch resources from
        the server, typically used to retrieve data from APIs. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response of the network
        request.
        
        The fetch() function supports both GET and POST requests and allows you to specify options such as headers, request
        method, and body. It can be used with async/await or Promise-based syntax for handling the response data.
        
        When the response is received, the fetch() function returns a Response object that can be used to read the response
        data, including the status code and headers. The response data can be in different formats, such as JSON, text, or
        binary data, and can be parsed or transformed depending on the use case.
        
        One important thing to note is that fetch() is a modern web API and may not be supported in older browsers. In those
        cases, you may need to use a polyfill or fallback mechanism.
